This is a landing page I made for freecodecamp. I decided to get a little more complex with this one and not just use HTML and CSS. I created this on codepen, so I was able to use javascript as well. If you oen the HTML file in a browser and it doesn't look right, that is because it is intended to be used with Babel. Here is the codepen link to the project so you can see what it really looks like and does: https://codepen.io/clayjoseph1994/pen/dyydPyj
