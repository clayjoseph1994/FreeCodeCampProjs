        <p>My name is Joseph Clay and I am 24 years old. Recently, a Senior UX Developer came into my place of employment and we had a conversation about possible positions at Lowe’s Corporate in Mooresville, North Carolina. He saw how dedicated and passionate I was regarding technology and web development. Though I have always dabbled in coding, building computers, and other tech-related areas, counseling was my intended career path in undergraduate studies. The plan was to double major in Psychology and Computer Science in college. It wasn’t until after the first semester of graduate school that I decided this was not the area best suited for my particular skills.</p>

<p>All along the way throughout this process, I kept playing around with coding and information security. I have taken many free courses and watched countless tutorials online to teach myself coding (Java, C#, Python), web development, and cybersecurity skills. There was an opportunity to enroll in a Cybersecurity Bootcamp a few months ago and I jumped at this chance. It has taught me a great deal about networking and using command-line interfaces and has provided me the ability to expand my knowledge of computer systems and how to keep them safe.</p>

<p>I recently began looking into the User Experience side of development. It makes a lot of sense because I have used plenty of websites and applications, and possess a basic understanding of what goes into their development. I took a class on web scripting and learned HTML5 and CSS3 back in undergraduate school and this has been the foundation of my journey in learning web development. The UX side of things seems to be a relatively new concept that consists of many vague descriptions, differing greatly from company to company. 

Personally, I believe any development should be done with the end-user in mind. The way an application functions, flows, and feels is extremely important to the day-to-day browsing experience. I want all the websites I visit to be stunning and to work smoothly. I want everything I do on the site to follow a progression that makes sense and feels right. Currently, I am working on my own website, and plan to showcase completed projects here in the future to build a portfolio to show off my skills. I intend to build this site with the user experience in mind. I want it to look, feel, and function smoothly, and I want the navigation of the site to be enjoyable.</p>

<p>Psychology teaches that there are colors that invoke specific emotions and convey certain feelings to people. Approaching web design with this in mind is a great skill to develop. It’s also a good idea to build any applications/websites with a logical flow in mind. Making something look pretty isn’t enough; it also has to be buttery smooth and snappy.</p>

<p>Researching the UX side of development has sparked my interest, and I began to complete free coding tutorials and create sample projects in HTML using CSS for the styling. I have learned what it takes to incorporate Material Design elements into coding and have seen how seamless this makes the functionality of pages. I intend to pour every ounce of my free time for the foreseeable future into cultivating more web development skills, specifically as it applies to the concepts of the end-user experience. </p>
